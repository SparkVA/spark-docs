## A Message from The Founders
Hello Members, 

Let us be the first to welcome you to the Spark Team and what is the start of your career with our growing Virtual Community.

We created Spark originally as a virtual airline back in the 2010s as we saw a need for a laid back atmosphere with freedom to do what you desire. Today, we’re still going strong.

Joining any community is very similar to picking an employer. You want good value for your time, a great set of coworkers, and an environment you feel that you’re comfortable with, and desire to give back to.

Over the years, we’ve learned many lessons. This document is a culmination of those lessons learned. One of which was to have documentation in the first place.

ave fun and see you in our virtual skies!
