## Activity Requirements
Members maintain their activity status based on the flights that are flown and logged via our website.

Spark bases its activity on the last flight logged in our website. Once a flight is accepted, the activity clock resets.

!!! warning "New Hire Notice"

    New Members __**shall**__ complete one flight within fourteen (14) days of account activation. If a pilot fails to complete a flight, and does not contact staff, their account will be subject to deletion.


### Leave of Absensce
Members who wish to take a Leave of Absence can take up to six months (180 Days) leave at one time. Members are allowed to take this leave once every year if they desire. Members wishing to do so must contact a member of the Executive Staff via email (staff@flyspark.org) with the amount of time they wish to take. 

Please note that if you complete a flight on our system, unless prior communication is established otherwise, your account will automatically get moved to Active status.

### Data Retension
In accordance with EU's GDPR, Spark considers accounts “inactive” when the following conditions are met after 180 days: (1) have not filed a PIREP. (2) Have not logged into the website.

**Unless a written request has been received to keep the account. Spark will, at any time, delete inactive accounts without notice.**

If you find that your account has been Suspended before the 6 month deadline, contact the executive team to re-activate your account.

## Flight Requirements

### Flight Validity

All flights are tracked and logged on our website by using following approved tracking methods:

- Desktop Based Clients
    - smartCARS 3
    - vmsACARS
- Online ATC Network With Verifiable Records Of the Flight
- Manually Filed Via The Website

!!! warning "Notice Regarding Manually Filed Reports"

    All PIREPs should be filed via our approved ACARS clients. However, we understand there are reasons why this may not be possible.
    
    Each PIREP filed manually must contain comments to justify filing manually. Eg. you performed a flight that smartCARS can't track, flight tracking failed, etc.
    
    All submissions must contain a link to evidence that the flight was flown with the hours specified in the "Flight Time" field.
    
    If you do encounter an issue with ACARS, please contact support via Discord, as depending on the issue, we still may have your flight tracking data, and we could possibly “resurrect” your report.


A flight is considered valid when the user has successfully flown between the departure point and either the intended arrival point or alternate point using at least one of the approved tracking methods. If the departure point and arrival point are the same point, the user must satisfy one of the following minimum requirements:

- fly greater than 10NM from the departure/arrival point
- 30 minutes Flying Time (Block Off to Block On)

If the departure point and arrival points are separate locations, there is no minimum distance or time.

### Scheduled Flight Requirements

Left Blank

### Mission Flight Requirements

Missions
:   Missions are Spark's verision of Charter Flights. These are hand curated flights that aim to provide a fun and unique twist to operations.

Once a mission has been accepted, the pilot accepting the mission will have 72hrs from the time of acceptance to fly the route. If the pilot flying the mission is unable to fly within 72hrs, contact the poster

Should the pilot accepting not fly the mission route, a notification will be sent to the via email and discord message as a reminder of the pending flight every 24hrs.

If the pilot flying the route is unable to complete or has personal life interfere with the flight progress, the pilot can request that the flight be removed from their schedule and reassigned to the next bidder.

If the flight is not completed in 72hrs from the date of acceptance, the flight shall be removed from the accepting pilots flight schedule. If the pilot has to be removed from the flight, a written warning will be issued.

If any pilot should accumulate 3 or more written warnings, the pilot will be suspended from mission operations for one (1) calendar month from the date of the last warning.

## Double Dipping

Double Dipping 
:   Double dipping is where a pilot flies for our community, and another community at the same time using different tracking methods. It allows members to gain hours at multiple communities while only doing one flight.

Spark Virtual Aviation ALLOWS for members to participate in “Double Dipping.” We will never restrict our members to just flying for our community.

!!! warning Warning!
    Only flights which are __self created__ via Free Flight and Trips, or via the schedule, are allowed to be double dipped. Missions, or other events, that are created by staff or other members, **shall** not be double dipped.


Spark REQUIRES members who wish to “double dip” to do the following:

- You MUST fly your monthly activity requirements solely for Spark. Double dipping is not allowed for monthly activity flights.
- You must put in the “PIREP Comments” section of SmartCARS that they were double dipping for the flight they were flying
    - EXAMPLE: THIS FLIGHT WAS FLOWN AND LOGGED FOR HOURS AT SPARK AND (insert other community here)
- All Spark Policies and Procedures must be followed

Members that are found to be “double dipping” and do not have a record of that in their PIREP Comments will be subject to having their PIREP for Spark rejected. Continuous double dipping WITHOUT proper documentation will result in account suspension.
